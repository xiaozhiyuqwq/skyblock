Roving one way or another

Back and forth with drifting water

When the site is getting closer

My steps falter

Despite long rides, I wanna take flight

What a bitter plight

But that special site

Still warm and bright

Draws memory to sight

Once in this life of game

I did mist my aim

Believing farness would be tamed

Without any fear of going down in flame

Now I have tasted it all

When I recall

My heart is beset by a high wall

Just for your smile, I can't resist but fall

I dreamed to enter a fanciful gate

Then encounter my dear soulmate

Bearing the weight

Embracing fate

Defying heat

Yeears of bloom once wrote the best refrain

Singing our love with no chain

Listen to your heart and just let it reign

Against the light, I stand all winds and rains

Stuttering along the bumpy road

I find so far I have climbed

Wonder whether I have lost

You or myself behind

In my gentle reverie

love can defeat the time

Again in my sight

In blue morming light

Your smIle is so bright

Once in this life of game

I did mist my aim

Believing farness would be tamed

Without any fear of going down in flame

Now I have tasted it all

When I recall

My heart is beset by a high wall

Just for your smile, I can't resist but fall

I dreamed to enter a fanciful gate

Then encounter my dear soulmate

Bearing the weight

Embracing fate

Defying heat

Yeears of bloom once wrote the best refrain

Singing our love with no chain

Listem to your heart and just let it reign

Night breeze gives your gray hair a fond embrace

All the scars leave without a trace

Your changing face

Of glad grace

Light this place

Drag yourself home in deepening twilight

Draw yourself a dream as a flight

In this dream, you whisper with delight

I still feel amazed at the world gate

Can't help but think of that young date

Bearing the weight

Embracing fate

Defying heat

I have buried the story of her

Together with that tuneful summer

What I treasure

Might fade forever

Can love remember

The question and the answer
